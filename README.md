# Automatic-Hand-Sanitizer-Dispenser
IoT device automatic hand sanitizer dispenser.


The automatic hand sanitizer was created as an IoT gadget to allow for the contactless usage of hand sanitizers. The Arduino uno R3, ultrasonic distance sensor, relay module, water pump, and jumper wires were all used in this setup. To develop and upload the code, the Arduino app was utilized. The system test to spray sanitizer when the sensor detects a hand was successful.
